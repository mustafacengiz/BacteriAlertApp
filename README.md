# BacteriAlertApp
This repository is to build an app that predicts bacterial beach water pollution for Florida most pollluted Florida beaches.
The app is created as a part of my data science project during my time as a fellow at Insight Data Science.
I use the model that is trained in Insight-Data-Science-Boston-20A repository.
The link to the app is https://bacterialert.herokuapp.com
